# Face Recognition System üß†üì∏

This project implements a face recognition system using the [`face_recognition`](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library and OpenCV. It can detect and recognize multiple faces in real-time using a webcam or image files.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the Landmark Model

You need the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file from Dlib.  
You have two options:

#### Option A ‚Äì Automatic download:

```bash
python download_model.py
```

#### Option B ‚Äì Manual download:

1. Download from here:  
   [Dlib model download](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
2. Extract and place the `.dat` file in the root project directory.

### 3. Encode Known Faces

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate `encodings.pickle` storing face encodings for all people in `dataset/`.

---

### 4. Run Face Recognition

```bash
python recognize.py
```

This script will access your webcam and recognize known faces in real time.

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Output

The system predicts the person and displays a confidence score in real-time:
